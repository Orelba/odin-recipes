  <h2>Description</h2>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>250 - 500g / 8 - 16 oz round brie <em>or camembert</em></li>
    <li>2 tbsp honey or maple syrup (optional)</li>
    <li>1 thyme sprig (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>For Serving</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Crostini or other sturdy crackers</li>
    <li>1 bunch purple grapes (or green, optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types).</li>
    <li>Unwrap brie and place in a small, shallow ovenproof dish slightly larger than the brie (to be used for
      serving) OR a piece of crumbled baking / parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes (for 250g/80z), or until melted through. For 500g/1lb brie, increase to 25
      minutes. To check, gently touch the centre of the brie - it should feel very soft, like it is about to
      collapse if you press any harder.</li>
    <li>Carefully transfer to serving plate / board - it's delicate (transfer on paper if you used paper).</li>
    <li>Drizzle with honey, top with sprig of thyme (if using).</li>
    <li>Serve immediately with crostini on the side for scooping. Provide a knife to cut through the rind and a
      cheese or pate knife (or similar) to scoop cheese up onto crostini or crackers (plain or fruit/nut
      flavoured).</li>
  </ol>
